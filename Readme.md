# Tea-Timer Cat
### alias The Beckoning Cat aka Maneki Neko

This Cat is supposed to wait as long as it takes for your tea to steep, then draw back its arm and take out the tea bag.
It works.

## Parts:
Mini Servo Motor
Beckoning Cat
Arduino
Cables (as needed)
Duct tape (as needed)
The right size of wood or plastic to fill the cat and attach the motor (I used a q-tip box)

## Instructions:
Take the cat apart. Be careful they break easily, because they are made out of plastic. Remove the screws at the bottom and take out the moving arm. Take the arm and its attachments apart. You will only need the arm. Attach the motor to the plastic with duct tape. Attach the the servo horn to the motor and secure it with the screws. Secure the arm to the horn with screws and duct tape.

## Electronics:
Take the motor cable and make sure your cables are identifiable as +,- and controlling (mine were orange, red and brown). Take the + cable and plug it into the 5V Pin at the arduino. Take the - Pin and plug it into the GND(Ground)-Pin. And lastly put the controlling cable into Pin 9 (You can change this one).

## Todo:
Create an easy way to change the timing of tea timer. Add Battery.
